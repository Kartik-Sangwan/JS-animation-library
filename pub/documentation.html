      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        The AT-headings.js is the javascript file where all the code related to
        the library is present. Thus to include this library in your project
        simply download this file and link it to your html file where you want
        to use its features. There is no CSS files that need to linked. The only
        other library that AT-Headings.js uses is J-Query which is the second
        file that you have to link up. The code is given below:
      </p>
      <h3>Basic Usage Code:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create a HTML canvas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a new javascript file and add the following 5 lines which
          creates a new object of type At-heading and finds the canvas element
          and create a “context” required for drawing and animating the canvas
          element.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then simply call atHeading.displayHeading(canvas, ctx, title) which
          requires a canvas, ctx, and a heading parameter to be displayed on
          this canvas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now accessing say the slant animation is very simple just call the
          atHeading.slantAnimation(canvas, ctx) and voila the animation is ready
          and running on the canvas specified. All of this in just 5 minutes.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Instantiating Objects of At-Headings.js</h3>

      <p class="lead">
        Use const atHeadings = new atHeadings(color,pointSize); to instantiate
        an object of the library. There are two arguments that the constructor
        takes two arguments:
      </p>
      <h3>Basic Usage :</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          color: the colour of the particles of which the headings is made up
          of.
        </li>
        <li>
          pointSize: the size of the particles optimal range (1,10).
        </li>
        <li>
          This is the top-level object that has access to all of the functions
          that are required in-order to create all the
          animations/backgrounds/mouseTrails and different particles.
        </li>

      <h3>Functions relating to Headings Display in At-Headings.js</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        These function are used to draw the particles onto the canvas in many
        different ways including changing the shape/size/color look and other
        specific properties of the atoms.
      </p>
      <h3>Function Definitions :</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>draw</strong>Multiple draw methods are available which simply
          draw a SINGLE particle object on the ctx at location x, y specified.
          In a canvas x pixels is to the right and y pixels down. Note: y
          increases as we go down. Functions: draw(ctx, x, y), drawTriangle(),
          drawSquareTiles(), drawSquareTilesSeparateFilled() all take the same
          arguments. All these have different shapes and sizes that the
          developer can use.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>displayheading(title):</strong> is another important function
          that creates the required global list of all the atoms both the atoms
          and randomAtoms list. Use this function before initialising any
          animations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>changeColor(newColor):</strong> and changeSize(newSize) are
          descriptive of their name and change the respective property of the
          Heading.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >displayHeadingBasic(canvas, ctx, title, colour, size):</strong
          >
          function allows user to display a basic heading on the canvas
          specified. It takes 5 arguments and displays the title on the
          corresponding canvas which just has normal text.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>displayHeadingDynamic (title, headingId):</strong>is a
          function that uses DOM manipulation to create a spans of single
          character that appear from different location and different timings
          thus gives a animated effect. The function takes where headingId is
          the id of a element (possibly a div of h1) in which the title will be
          displayed.

      <h3>Functions relating to different BackGroundAnimations</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        These function are used to create dynamic backGrounds which are highly
        customizable and different types of headings can also be inserted on top
        of the canvas.
      </p>
      <h3>Function Definitions :</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong
            >applyBackGround(canvas, ctx, colValue, boxLength, close):</strong
          >function creates a spinning background that consists of boxes
          particles of varied length and whose colour differs from any other
          particle by slight. This is achieved using hsla() css property. The
          colVaue parameter is a a number between 0-360 that indicates rgb
          colour schema. boxLengths is the maximum length of the
          boxes/particles. close(ideally 10) is a parameter that provides
          randomness to the colour so that all the particles have slightly
          different colours. if close = 0 then perfect all particles have same
          colour as close increase the particles have more drastic colour
          changes from the ideal colValue specified.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >applyBackGroundLines(canvas, ctx, closeValue, colour,
            mouseOrNot):</strong
          >
          function creates a animation in which the atoms are randomly floating
          in the canvas space and if they are close enough specified by the
          threshold parameter closeValue(ideally 10), then a line is drawn
          between them for that animation frame. Color specifies the colour of
          the atoms. mouseOrNot(true/false) parameter specifies the whether the
          atoms are reactive to the mouse or not and thus repel the mouse or
          not.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >pipes(canvas, ctx, colorPipes, title, divId, sizeHeading,
            colHeading, widthPipes):</strong
          >function is a very interesting one as it creates a very pleasing and
          beautiful animation of pipes in the backGround and the title specified
          is created on the foreground using DOM manipulation. It is kind of
          similar to the windows pipes screensaver modified a bit. title is the
          heading to be displayed. divId is the id of the parent div in which
          the canvas is so that the heading can be “pasted” on top of the
          canvas. sizeHeading is the size of the heading in pixels. colHeading
          is a number between 0-360 for the rgb scheme. widthPipes is the width
          of the pipes in pixels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>createDomHeading(divId, title, size, col):</strong>
          function can be used to create a h1 heading that can be applied to the
          foreground of any canvas, where divId is the id of the parent of the
          canvas to which this heading needs be applied.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>clearHeading(divId):</strong>is a can be used to erase the
          heading element that was created in point 4 above.

      <h3>Functions relating to different Mouse Trailing Effect</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        These two functions are used to create some unique mouse trailing
        effects like windows mouse trail efect and rainbow mouse trail effect
        solely using DOM manipulation.
      </p>
      <h3>Function Definitions :</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>mouseTrail(canvas, ctx, radius, color):</strong>function
          creates a animation in which the atoms follow the mouse pointer when
          it is over the canvas specified. The size and colour of the atoms can
          be set easily. The animation has about 3 seconds in which all the
          atoms are initialised and bounce around after which all of the atoms
          disappear that is when the mouseTrail start and user can hover to the
          mouse over the canvas to see the effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>mouseTrail2(divId):</strong>

          Similar to the above mouse trial this one creates a rainbow effect
          using purely vanilla javascript and DOM manipulation and thus it is
          not fully optimised. However, the effect looks pretty nice. The divId
          parameter is where all the rainbow coloured boxed will be added and
          and eventListener is added to this divId.

      <h3>Functions relating to different Atomic Animation Effect</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        These are various functions that can be used in a variety of ways to
        produce effects like explosion, atoms repel from mouse, slantAnimation,
        scatterAtoms animations and tranforming a heading into another.
      </p>
      <h3>Function Definitions :</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>scatterAndComeBack(canvas, ctx, scatterTime):</strong>function
          is an animation which the particles appear to scatter for scatterTime
          amount and then comeBack to their original position that we specified
          when the title was created.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>slantAnimation(canvas, ctx):</strong>

          function groups treats the full heading title as a single group and
          all atoms have velocity in the same direction and change direction
          when they bounce off the edges of the canvas. This provides animation
          in which the headings particles all move collectively in a group.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>applyFlee(canvas, ctx, times, opt):</strong>

          function takes times which is the time duration in ms for which the
          animation will take place. In this animation when the use hovers the
          mouse near any of the characters of the heading the particles repel
          the mouse and when the mouse is far away specified by a threshold
          these particles return back to their original place. The opt argument
          if 0 all atoms are treated a single entity. If opt is 1 then only the
          first character of the heading controls the behaviour of all the rest
          of the characters in the heading. So just hovering over the first
          character will move/repel all the other atoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>transformHeading(canvas, ctx, h1, h2):</strong>
          takes two headings h1 and h2 and first display the h1 heading then
          after some fixed time scatters all the particles and then the
          particles appear to come into the h2 heading formation by converting
          the target of the h1 atoms to be the targets of the h2 atoms. It uses
          some helper function to achieve the number and order of these tasks .

          of uses such as demonstrating any ideas by drawing on the canvas,
          explaining tutorial and most importantly signing online documents on
          the web. The parameter are just the canvas its context and the size
